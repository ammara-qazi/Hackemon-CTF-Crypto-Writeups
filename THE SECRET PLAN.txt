DESCRIPTION: 
The file was recovered from a dead agent’s laptop — the screen still glowing, the tea beside it untouched.
The system had already begun wiping itself, but we were faster.

At 04:17 AM, our cyber surveillance unit intercepted a suspicious data packet embedded within encrypted military chatter. 
Hidden inside was a scrambled message — too chaotic to make sense, yet too deliberate to dismiss.

Preliminary analysis suggests the use of an older, manual encryption technique. No characters appear to be missing — just misplaced,
as if someone wanted this message to be unreadable to most… but decipherable to the right eyes.

We believe this communication reveals who the enemy plans to contact — or perhaps, who they’re targeting.
